TASK 2: Deep Learning Model (Image Classification)

In Task 2, the goal was to develop a deep learning model for either image classification or natural language processing (NLP). I chose image classification using the MNIST dataset—a widely-used benchmark dataset of handwritten digits. This task involved implementing a deep learning model using PyTorch, training it on the dataset, and visualizing its performance.

The first step involved loading the MNIST dataset using torchvision.datasets, applying transformations like normalization and tensor conversion. I split the data into training and testing sets and used DataLoader to manage mini-batch training efficiently.

Next, I constructed a feedforward neural network using PyTorch's nn.Module. The network included an input layer that flattened the 28x28 pixel images, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with 10 units (one for each digit). This architecture was simple but effective for the classification task.

The model was trained using CrossEntropyLoss as the loss function and the Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent. During training, I looped through the training data for multiple epochs, computed the loss, performed backpropagation, and updated weights. Loss values were printed to monitor convergence.

After training, I evaluated the model on the test set using accuracy as the performance metric. Predictions were generated, and the number of correct classifications was compared against the total to calculate the accuracy percentage. My model achieved over 95% accuracy, indicating good generalization.

I also visualized sample test images along with their predicted labels to qualitatively assess model performance. This provided an intuitive understanding of how well the model learned to distinguish between digits.

This task deepened my understanding of deep learning, neural network architectures, and PyTorch’s workflow. It also reinforced the importance of hyperparameter tuning and proper evaluation techniques. By completing this task, I gained hands-on experience in implementing, training, and testing a functional image classification model using deep learning frameworks.
